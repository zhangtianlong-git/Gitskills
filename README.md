### *Line*
**********
There are many ways to create a line in README.md, and let us have a look!<br>
We can insert "------" into a new line in this file, as follows.It is  the same to use  "*****" and "______".

-------------------
___________________
*******************

### *Title*
***********
Transform a word into title using "============="
===========================
Transform a word into title using "-------------"
---------------------------
# Transform a word into title using "#"
## Transform a word into title using "##", and you can add more "#".

### *text*
*****
Add a "Tab" at the beginning of one line, and you can transform it into text formatting. Just as follows.

	I have add a "Tab" before this sentence.
	You can continue to write here.
What is more. We can use \``` \```.
```
I have add ``` at the beginning of lastrow.
I have add ``` at the beginning of nextrow.
```
We can also chage fonts, and just follow this table:

|Syntax|Performance|
|----|-----|
|`*Italic1*`|*Italic1*|
|`_Italic2_`| _Italic2_|
|`**Bold1**`|**Bold1**|
|`__Bold2__`|__Bold2__|
|`This is ~~Strikethrough~~`|This is ~~Strikethrough~~|

We can combine two or three of them when using.

### *Picture*
*****
We can add a picture into our log using:\![picture name](URL of the picture)<br>
Just like `![sky](http://p3.gexing.com/G1/M00/25/2E/rBACE1b_F9PSVH2VAACkQ3N6d8Y647_600x.jpg "The Beautifual Sky!")`<br>

![picture2](http://img.zcool.cn/community/014cca554bfd99000001bf7289bb04.jpg "The Beautifual Sky!")
